#### Figures

## Figure 1: Tremapify plots for TE copy number and TE bp, alongside pointRange plots for Length, Gene Dist, Prop in transcript, and proportion in another TE
  - figure1.R
  
## Figure 2: Chromosome distribution on chromosome 1
  - figure2.R
  - *todo* remove xlab title on B-D
  
## Figure 3: Age distribution of TE superfamilies and families
  - figure3.R
  
## Figure 4: Expression heatmap, TE protein coding, tau vs coding, age vs. coding
  - figure4.R
  - *todo* new expr results
  
## Figure 5: TE vs Flank - methylation, base composition, and segregating sites
  - figure5.R
  - *todo* decide whether I need all methylation contexts? I like them...
  
## Figure 6: Model results - importance ranking, summarized importance by superfamily, ice plot of all, ice plot of fams, raw correlations?
  - barplot of each order, importance of aggregated and individual features
  - eli5 circle plot

# Other Figures:
  - genedist vs gene expression?
  - gene-te expression corr by tissue?
  
## Supplementary figs
  - tau
  - prop transcriptome
  - median gene expression across tissues, rec rate

## What is missing:
  - host gene expression!!!
