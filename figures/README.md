#### Figures


## Figure 1: Tremapify plots for TE copy number and TE bp
## Figure 2: pointRange plots for Length, Gene Dist, Prop in transcript, and proportion in another TE
  - figure1and2.R
  
## Figure 3: Chromosome distribution on chromosome 1
  - figure3.chrDist.R
  
## Figure 4: Age distribution of TE superfamilies and families
  - figure4.ages.R
  
## Figure 5: Expression heatmap, TE protein coding, tau vs coding, age vs. coding
  - figure5.coding_expr.R
  
## Figure 6: TE vs Flank - methylation, base composition, and segregating sites
  - figure6.R
  
## Figure 7: Model results - importance ranking, summarized importance by superfamily, ice plot of all, ice plot of fams, raw correlations?
  - figure7.R
  
## Table 1: TE facts
  - table1.R
  
## Supplementary figs
  - plotted as separate PDFs in each figure code

## Numbers explained in text
  - lots of extraneous numbers calculated, but `generating_numbers_stated_in_text.R` contains code that helps get TE order level summaries


`meanSD_functions.R` is general plotting functions - I designed the pointrange to grab medians and quartiles.
