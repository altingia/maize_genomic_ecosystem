### Model age of each TE

- `generate_model_input.R` makes a large data table of all the features, writes a file `B73.LTRAGE.allDescriptors.Date.txt` and `B73.TBLAGE.allDescriptors.Date.txt`
- `random_forest_pdp.R` runs the model, (hardcoded to use data from `B73.LTRAGE.allDescriptors.2019-01-31.txt`)


These summary files are uploaded to figshare [doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7781000](doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7781000), as they are too large to be hosted on github.
